    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet
      Applications, and it's a set of attributes that can be
      added to HTML elements to make them more accessible to
      people using assistive technologies, such as screen
      readers. ARIA can provide additional information about
      an element's functionality and behavior, such as its
      role, properties, and states. For example, the
      "aria-label" property can help assistive technologies
      accurately convey the purpose of a button. ARIA can
      also enable keyboard interaction and focus management
      for elements that are not normally interactive or
      focusable. However, ARIA doesn't change an element's
      visual appearance or functionality</p>

    <!--The aria-label attribute defines a string value that labels an interactive element.  -->
    <input type="field" aria-placeholder="username" placeholder="username" aria-label="username field">
    <br><br>
    <!-- The aria-placeholder attribute defines a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to help the user with data entry when a form control has no value. The hint can be a sample value or a brief description of the expected format. -->
    <input type="field" aria-placeholder="password" placeholder="password" id="pwField" aria-label="password field">
    <label for="password">Password</label>
    <br><br>
    <button aria-label="submit">Submit</button>
